The Lost Boys (I'm in the red vest.)

## About
I was in the play Peter Pan in 2018. I acted as a lost boy from Neverland named Tootles. This play was about a boy named Peter Pan who lives in Neverland. He met three kids: Michael, John, and Wendy. The lost boys asked Wendy to be their mother, and she stays with them for a while. Then Captain Hook tries to kill the lost boys and kidnap Wendy. The brave girls led by Tiger Lily become friends with the lost boys. They go to Captain Hooks ship to defeat him, and he gets chased off by a crocodile.

## How I Felt
I really liked acting in the Peter Pan play. It was fun because we had very productive rehearsals, but we still got to talk and hang out. I made a lot of new friends, and I think they really helped me become a better actor. I really enjoyed this play because of the directors, too. Our directors were Mrs. Sanders, who was in charge of lights and the set. Ms. Nicholson was in charge of blocking, which is when we applied movement to the dialogue. Ms. White worked on choreography for the music, and Mrs. Marshall helped us learn our music and helped us with our vocals.

## Honorable Mention
I would have never gotten into acting if my chorus teacher Mrs. Marshall hadn't asked me to be a lost boy.
