## About
I was in the play Peter Pan in 2018. I acted as a lost boy from Neverland named tootles. This play was about a boy named peter pan who lives in neverland. He met three kids, Michael, John and, Wendy. The lost boys ask wendy to be their mother an she stays with them for a while. Then Captain Hook tries to kill the lost boys and kidnap Wendy. Then the brave girls led by Tiger Lily become friends with the lost boys. Then go to Captain Hooks ship to defeat him and he gets chased of by a crocodile.

## How I Felt
I really liked acting in the Peter Pan play. It was fun because we had very productive rehearsals but we still got to talk and hang out. I made a lot of new friends and I think they really helped me become a better actor. I really enjoyed this play because of the directors too. Our directors were Mrs. Sanders, She was in charge of lights and the set. Ms. Nicholson was in charge of blocking, which is when apply movement to the dialogue. Ms. White worked on choreography for the music and Mrs. Marshall helped us ![I'm Flying] ({{i'm_flying.jpg}}/plays/2018/peter_pan.md) learn our music and helped us with our vocals.
