## About
I was in the play Peter Pan in 2018. I acted as a lost boy from Neverland named tootles. This play was about a boy named peter pan who lives in neverland. He met three kids, Michael, John and, Wendy. The lost boys ask wendy to be their mother an she stays with them for a while. Then Captain Hook tries to kill the lost boys and kidnap Wendy. Then the brave girls led by Tiger Lily become friends with the lost boys. Then go to Captain Hooks ship to defeat him and he gets chased of by a crocodile.
