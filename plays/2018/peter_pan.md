I was in the play Peter Pan in 2018. I acted as a lost boy from Neverland named tootles. I really liked acting in this play. It was fun because we had very productive rehearsals but we still got to talk and hang out. I made a lot of new friends and I think they really helped me become a better actor. I really enjoyed this play because of the directors too. Our directors were Mrs. Sanders, She was in charge of lights and the set. Ms. Nicholson was in charge of blocking, which is when apply movement to the dialogue. Ms. White worked on choreography for the music and Mrs. Marshall helped us learn our music and helped us with our vocals.
