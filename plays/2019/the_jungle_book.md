## About
I was in the play The Jungle Book in May 2019. The Jungle Book is about a boy named Mowgli. He lives in the jungle with a lot of animals. Mowgli was raised by wolves but he was different so the other cubs made fun of him. Then Mowgli met Shere Khan, a tiger who likes to eat humans. Baloo is a bear who tries to teach Mowgli the way of the wolves. But then, Mowgli runs off with the monkeys and they try and trick him into helping them not be outcasts. When Akela the alpha wolf gets too old and has to step down, Shere Khan takes her place. Finally, Mowgli challenges Shere Khan, kills him, and then goes back to his home village.

## My Character
I acted as Mowgli in this play. Mowgli is the main protagonist and is human. Mowgli grew up in the jungle and was raised by wolves. All the cubs made fun of him. Mowgli ended up saving the jungle from the tiger Shere Khan. Mowgli is friends with Baloo, who teaches him all about the jungle and wolves. 

## My Feelings
My directors name was Amy Beach. She was really nice and funny. I acted with some of the kids who were in the Peter Pan play. I also made some new friends. This play wasn't for school like Peter Pan--it was with a company called Stage Door Productions. Most of the people I worked with were really nice. They were all really good actors and were funny.
