## About
I was in the play The Jungle Book in May 2019. The Jungle Book is about a boy named Mowgli. He lives in the jungle with a lot of animals. Mowgli was raised by wolves but he was different so the other cubs made fun of him. Then mowgli met Shere Khan, a tiger who likes to eat humans. Baloo is a bear who tries to teach Mowgli the way of the wolves. But then, Mowgli runs off with the monkeys and they try and trick him into helping them not be outcasts. Then Akela the alpha wolf is old and has to step down and Shere Khan takes the place of her. Finally Mowgli chalenges Shere Khan and kills him then Mowgli goes back to his home village.
