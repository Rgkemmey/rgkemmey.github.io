## About
I was in the play The Lion King in Oct 2019. This was a musical about a lion named Simba. Simba's dad, Mufasa, was king of Pride Rock. Scar, Mufasa's brother, tried to overthrow him and ended up killing him. In fear, Simba ran to the jungle where he met Timon and Pumbaa. After that Nala, who is Simba's best friend came to the jungle looking for help she tried to get him to go back but he wouldn't. Rafiki decided to convince Simba into going back and he challenged Scar. Scar got defeated and Simba became king.

## My Role
I acted as grown-up Simba. Simba is the mailn character in The Lion King. Simba became friends with Timon and Pumbaa. They teach him about the jungle and he eats the same food as them, grub. After his dad is killed in a wildebeest stampede he becomes rightful king, but his Uncle Scar tricks him into thinking it's all his fault so he runs off. Then Rafiki tell him that even though his dad is dead there is still a part of his dad in him. Simba goes back and defeats Scar.
