## About
I was in the play The Lion King in Oct 2019. This was a musical about a lion named Simba. Simba's dad, Mufasa, was king of Pride Rock. Scar, Mufasa's brother, tried to overthrow him and ended up killing him. In fear, Simba ran to the jungle where he met Timon and Pumbaa. After that Nala, who is Simba's best friend came to the jungle looking for help she tried to get him to go back but he wouldn't. Rafiki decided to convince Simba into going back and he challenged Scar. Scar got defeated and Simba became king.
