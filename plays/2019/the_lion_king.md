## About
I was in the play The Lion King in Oct 2019. This was a musical about a lion named Simba. Simba's dad, Mufasa, was king of Pride Rock. Scar, Mufasa's brother, tried to overthrow him and ended up killing him. In fear, Simba ran to the jungle where he met Timon and Pumbaa. After that Nala, who is Simba's best friend, came to the jungle looking for help. She tried to get Simba to go back, but he wouldn't. Rafiki finally convinced Simba to go back home, where Simba challenged Scar. Scar was defeated, and Simba became king.

## My Role
I acted as grown-up Simba. Simba is the main character in The Lion King. Simba became friends with Timon and Pumbaa. They teach him about the jungle, and he eats the same food as them--grubs! After his dad is killed in a wildebeest stampede, he becomes rightful king, but his Uncle Scar tricks him into thinking his father's death is all his fault, so he runs off. Then Rafiki tells him that even though his dad is dead, there is still a part of his dad in him. Simba goes back and defeats Scar.

## My Feelings
I really enjoyed this musical because The Lion King is my favorite Disney movie. I had the same directors in this musical as in Peter Pan. In this play, I made a lot of new friends and even saw some of the people who were also in Peter Pan. We had some of the Freshmen in highschool come back to help. They helped people memorize lines, and they helped build the set. Over all this was a great production.
